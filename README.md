# Description
TABLER is a command-line interface application that converts lines of text from an input file into a table displayed on the terminal.

# Usage
- make `TABLER.sh` file executable by `chmod +x bin/main-script.sh`.
- run the run with a text file as an argument(`./TABLER.sh input.txt`)

# Testing
**Run the tests**:
```bash
./test_target_script.sh
```
This script will execute `target_script.sh` with various inputs and compare the output.png files against the expected results.
